# CX Cloud deployment chart

CX Cloud deployment chart is a Helm chart for deploying microservices easily into a Kubernetes cluster. The helm chart has support for the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/) and works well together with [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks).

## Getting started

### Installing the chart

Add the repository:

```bash
helm repo add cxcloud https://cxcloud.github.io/helm-charts
```

Update repositories:

```bash
helm repo update
```

To install the chart with version `0.1.2` and release name `my-release` into the namespace `production`:

```bash
helm upgrade -i my-release cxcloud/cxcloud-deployment-chart \
  --version 0.1.2 \
  --namespace production
```

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `my-release` deployment from namespace `kube-system`:

```bash
helm uninstall my-release --namespace kube-system
```

### Configuration
